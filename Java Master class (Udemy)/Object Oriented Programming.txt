OOP allows us to do to create classes commonly used standard behavior from other classes

ex animals
- we could create a very basic class that we could actually apply to each and every animal out there,
and that we know that any animal would have these traits

->create class 'Animal' add state(field) and behavior(method)

->create class'Dog' which inherit from 'Animal'class

->create constructor to use Animal fields 
	*super is to call the constructor that is for the class that we're extending from.
	*we can assign extra states(fields) and extra behaviors(methods) that aren't necessarily applicable to other animals
