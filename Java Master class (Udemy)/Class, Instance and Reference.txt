Class :bluprint of a house

Instance: build an house based on the blueprint	
	Using  the blueprint, we can build as mary houses as we like based on those blueprints.

Reference: address of paticular house.	
	we can pass references as parameters to constuctors and methods

	references
House    	<------------  blueHouse
	<--------- anotherHouse

(two references that point to the same object in memory)

anotherHouse.setColor("yellow"):
->
blueHouse.getColor();="yellow"


Once we change the color of one,both references still point to the same object
= there is still just one physical house at that one address, even though we have written the same address on two pieces of paper.
